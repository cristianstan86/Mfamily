            <div class="info1"><p><h3>Advengers End Game</h3></p>
                <br>
            <p><h4>The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later removed this title. 
                The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. 
                The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. 
                The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. 
                Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with Infinity War, 
                and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, 
                and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of
                 the most expensive films ever made.Avengers: Endgame premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United 
                 States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, 
                 visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.798 billion worldwide, 
                 surpassing Infinity War's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the 
                 highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021 and the hightest-grossing film released by Disney. It received a nomination 
                 for "Best Visual Effects" at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. A fifth and sixth film, 
                 Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, 
                 are scheduled to be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively.

                <p><h3>Fast and Fourious series</h3></p>
                <br>
                <p><h4> Fast & Furious franchise has spanned over 20 years, nine films and multiple spin-offs.The high-octane series of 
                films began in 2001 with the rather low-stakes street-racing and gangster thriller 
                The Fast and the Furious and focused on the difficult relationship between Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) 
                and undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker).However, since then the franchise has only got bigger in size, preposterousness, 
                and ambition – and the complicated narrative the twelve films have woven together can be difficult to follow.<br>Here are 
                the movies in chronological order:

                The Fast and the Furious (2001)
                    2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
                    Fast & Furious (2009)
                    Fast Five (2011)
                    Fast & Furious 6 (2013)
                    The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)
                    Furious 7 (2015)
                    The Fate of the Furious (2017)
                    Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)
